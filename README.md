An AI-powered tool to classify news articles as real or fake using NLP and machine learning. This project supports social awareness initiatives by Tamizhan Skills and aims to help flag misleading content on social media.
## 🚩 Problem Statement
Fake news on social media misleads people. Can we build an AI tool to detect it?
## 🎯 Objective
- Use NLP and machine learning to classify news articles as real or fake.
- Train and evaluate models for high accuracy and reliability.
## 🗂️ Dataset
- Labeled news articles (real/fake).
- Example: [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Load labeled news articles.
2. **Preprocessing:** 
    - Tokenize text
    - Remove stopwords
    - Apply TF-IDF vectorization
3. **Modeling:** Train a Passive Aggressive Classifier or SVM.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess using accuracy and F1 score.
